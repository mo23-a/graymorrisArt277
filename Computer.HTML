            A computer is a machine that can be programmed to manipulate symbols. Its principal characteristics are:
            <ol type="1">
               <li>It responds to a specific set of instructions in a well-defined manner.</li> 
               <li>It can execute a prerecorded list of instructions (a program).</li> 
               <li>It can quickly store and retrieve large amounts of data.</li> 
            </ol>  
            Therefore computers can perform complex and repetitive procedures quickly, precisely and reliably. Modern computers are electronic and digital. The actual machinery (wires, transistors, and circuits) is called hardware; the instructions and data are called software. All general-purpose computers require the following hardware components:
            <ul Type="square">
                <li> Central processing unit (CPU): The heart of the computer, this is the component that actually executes instructions organized in programs ("software") which tell the computer what to do.</li>
                <li>Memory (fast, expensive, short-term memory): Enables a computer to store, at least temporarily, data, programs, and intermediate results.</li>
                <li>Mass storage device (slower, cheaper, long-term memory): Allows a computer to permanently retain large amounts of data and programs between jobs. Common mass storage devices include disk drives and tape drives.</li>
                <li>Input device: Usually a keyboard and mouse, the input device is the conduit through which data and instructions enter a computer.</li>
                <li>Output device: A display screen, printer, or other device that lets you see what the computer has accomplished.</li>
            </ul>
            In addition to these components, many others make it possible for the basic components to work together efficiently. For example, every computer requires a bus that transmits data from one part of the computer to another.
